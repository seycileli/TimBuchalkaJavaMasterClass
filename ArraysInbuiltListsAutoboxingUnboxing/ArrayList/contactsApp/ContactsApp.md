    Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the follow capabilities
    Able to store, modify (edit), remove, and query (search) for contacts (by name)

    You will want to create a separate class called Contacts,
    Create instance variables of Contacts, Phone Number

    Create a Master Class called MobilePhone that holds an ArrayList of Contacts
    The Mobile Phones functionalities are listed below:
            add a menu of options that are available
            options include: quit application
            print list of contacts
            add a new contact
            update existing contact
            remove/ delete a contact
            and a search/ find contact

    When adding or updating, make sure that the contact already exists (user name)
    Be sure not to expose the inner workings of ArrayList to MobilePhone (encapsulate/ make fields private)
    e.g. no ints, no .get(i) methods and etc

    MobilePhone class should do everything with the Contacts class (via it's objects) only
